# /etc/login.defs - Configuration control definitions for the login package.
#
# Three items must be defined:  MAIL_DIR, ENV_SUPATH, and ENV_PATH.
# If unspecified, some arbitrary (and possibly incorrect) value will
# be assumed.  All other items are optional - if not specified then
# the described action or option will be inhibited.
#
# Comment lines (lines beginning with &#34;#&#34;) and blank lines are ignored.

# REQUIRED for useradd/userdel/usermod
#   Directory where mailboxes reside, _or_ name of file, relative to the
#   home directory.  If you _do_ define MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE,
#   MAIL_DIR takes precedence.
#
#   Essentially:
#      - MAIL_DIR defines the location of users mail spool files
#        (for mbox use) by appending the username to MAIL_DIR as defined
#        below.
#      - MAIL_FILE defines the location of the users mail spool files as the
#        fully-qualified filename obtained by prepending the user home
#        directory before $MAIL_FILE
#
# NOTE: This is no more used for setting up users MAIL environment variable
#       which is, starting from shadow 4.0.12-1 in Debian, entirely the
#       job of the pam_mail PAM modules
#       See default PAM configuration files provided for
#       login, su, etc.
#
# This is a temporary situation: setting these variables will soon
# move to /etc/default/useradd and the variables will then be
# no more supported
MAIL_DIR        /var/mail
#MAIL_FILE      .mail

#
# Enable logging and display of /var/log/faillog login failure info.
# This option conflicts with the pam_tally PAM module.
#
FAILLOG_ENAB		yes

# Enable display of unknown usernames when login failures are recorded.
#
# WARNING: Unknown usernames may become world readable. 
# See #290803 and #298773 for details about how this could become a security
# concern
LOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB	no

#
# Enable logging of successful logins
#
LOG_OK_LOGINS		no

#
# Enable &#34;syslog&#34; logging of su activity - in addition to sulog file logging.
# SYSLOG_SG_ENAB does the same for newgrp and sg.
#
SYSLOG_SU_ENAB		yes
SYSLOG_SG_ENAB		yes

#
# If defined, all su activity is logged to this file.
#
#SULOG_FILE	/var/log/sulog

#
# If defined, file which maps tty line to TERM environment parameter.
# Each line of the file is in a format something like &#34;vt100  tty01&#34;.
#
#TTYTYPE_FILE	/etc/ttytype

#
# If defined, login failures will be logged here in a utmp format
# last, when invoked as lastb, will read /var/log/btmp, so...
#
FTMP_FILE	/var/log/btmp

#
# If defined, the command name to display when running &#34;su -&#34;.  For
# example, if this is defined as &#34;su&#34; then a &#34;ps&#34; will display the
# command is &#34;-su&#34;.  If not defined, then &#34;ps&#34; would display the
# name of the shell actually being run, e.g. something like &#34;-sh&#34;.
#
SU_NAME		su

#
# If defined, file which inhibits all the usual chatter during the login
# sequence.  If a full pathname, then hushed mode will be enabled if the
# user&#39;s name or shell are found in the file.  If not a full pathname, then
# hushed mode will be enabled if the file exists in the user&#39;s home directory.
#
HUSHLOGIN_FILE	.hushlogin

# *REQUIRED*  The default PATH settings, for superuser and normal users.

# Terminal permissions
#
#	TTYGROUP	Login tty will be assigned this group ownership.
#	TTYPERM		Login tty will be set to this permission.
#
# If you have a &#34;write&#34; program which is &#34;setgid&#34; to a special group
# which owns the terminals, define TTYGROUP to the group number and
# TTYPERM to 0620.  Otherwise leave TTYGROUP commented out and assign
# TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.
#
# In Debian /usr/bin/bsd-write or similar programs are setgid tty
# However, the default and recommended value for TTYPERM is still 0600
# to not allow anyone to write to anyone else console or terminal

# Users can still allow other people to write them by issuing 
# the &#34;mesg y&#34; command.

#	UMASK		Default &#34;umask&#34; value.
#
# The ERASECHAR and KILLCHAR are used only on System V machines.
# 
# UMASK is the default umask value for pam_umask and is used by
# useradd and newusers to set the mode of the new home directories.
# 022 is the &#34;historical&#34; value in Debian for UMASK
# 027, or even 077, could be considered better for privacy
# There is no One True Answer here : each sysadmin must make up his/her
# mind.
#
# If USERGROUPS_ENAB is set to &#34;yes&#34;, that will modify this UMASK default value
# for private user groups, i. e. the uid is the same as gid, and username is
# the same as the primary group name: for these, the user permissions will be
# used as group permissions, e. g. 022 will become 002.

# Prefix these values with &#34;0&#34; to get octal, &#34;0x&#34; to get hexadecimal.

# Max number of login retries if password is bad. This will most likely be

# Max time in seconds for login
#
LOGIN_TIMEOUT		60

#
# Which fields may be changed by regular users using chfn - use

# Should login be allowed if we can&#39;t cd to the home directory?

# It should remove any at/cron/print jobs etc. owned by

#USERDEL_CMD	/usr/sbin/userdel_local

#
# Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits
# (examples: 022 -&gt; 002, 077 -&gt; 007) for non-root users, if the uid is
# the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.
#
# If set to yes, userdel will remove the user&#39;s group if it contains no
# more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name
# of the user.
#
USERGROUPS_ENAB yes

#
# Instead of the real user shell, the program specified by this parameter
# will be launched, although its visible name (argv[0]) will be the shell&#39;s.
# The program may do whatever it wants (logging, additional authentification,
# banner, ...) before running the actual shell.
#
# FAKE_SHELL /bin/fakeshell

#
# If defined, either full pathname of a file containing device names or
# a &#34;:&#34; delimited list of device names.  Root logins will be allowed only
# upon these devices.
#
# This variable is used by login and su.
#
#CONSOLE	/etc/consoles
#CONSOLE	console:tty01:tty02:tty03:tty04

#
# List of groups to add to the user&#39;s supplementary group set
# when logging in on the console (as determined by the CONSOLE
# setting).  Default is none.
#
# Use with caution - it is possible for users to gain permanent
# access to these groups, even when not logged in on the console.
# How to do it is left as an exercise for the reader...
#
# This variable is used by login and su.
#
#CONSOLE_GROUPS		floppy:audio:cdrom

#
# If set to &#34;yes&#34;, new passwords will be encrypted using the MD5-based
# algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases of FreeBSD.
# It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt strings.
# Set to &#34;no&#34; if you need to copy encrypted passwords to other systems
# which don&#39;t understand the new algorithm.  Default is &#34;no&#34;.
#
# This variable is deprecated. You should use ENCRYPT_METHOD.
#
#MD5_CRYPT_ENAB	no

#
# If set to MD5 , MD5-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA256, SHA256-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to SHA512, SHA512-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password
# If set to DES, DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password (default)
# Overrides the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB option
#
# Note: It is recommended to use a value consistent with
# the PAM modules configuration.
#
ENCRYPT_METHOD SHA512

#
# Only used if ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to SHA256 or SHA512.
#
# Define the number of SHA rounds.
# With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute forcing the password.
# But note also that it more CPU resources will be needed to authenticate
# users.
#
# If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds (5000).
# The values must be inside the 1000-999999999 range.
# If only one of the MIN or MAX values is set, then this value will be used.
# If MIN &gt; MAX, the highest value will be used.
#
# SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS 5000
# SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS 5000
