# Login access control table.
#
# Comment line must start with &#34;#&#34;, no space at front.
# Order of lines is important.
#
# When someone logs in, the table is scanned for the first entry that
# matches the (user, host) combination, or, in case of non-networked
# logins, the first entry that matches the (user, tty) combination.  The
# permissions field of that table entry determines whether the login will
# be accepted or refused.
#
# Format of the login access control table is three fields separated by a
# &#34;:&#34; character:
#
# [Note, if you supply a &#39;fieldsep=|&#39; argument to the pam_access.so
# module, you can change the field separation character to be
# &#39;|&#39;. This is useful for configurations where you are trying to use
# pam_access with X applications that provide PAM_TTY values that are
# the display variable like &#34;host:0&#34;.]
#
# 	permission:users:origins
#
# The first field should be a &#34;+&#34; (access granted) or &#34;-&#34; (access denied)
# character.
#
# The second field should be a list of one or more login names, group
# names, or ALL (always matches). A pattern of the form user@host is
# matched when the login name matches the &#34;user&#34; part, and when the
# &#34;host&#34; part matches the local machine name.
#
# The third field should be a list of one or more tty names (for
# non-networked logins), host names, domain names (begin with &#34;.&#34;), host
# addresses, internet network numbers (end with &#34;.&#34;), ALL (always
# matches), NONE (matches no tty on non-networked logins) or
# LOCAL (matches any string that does not contain a &#34;.&#34; character).
#
# You can use @netgroupname in host or user patterns; this even works
# for @usergroup@@hostgroup patterns.
#
# The EXCEPT operator makes it possible to write very compact rules.
#
# The group file is searched only when a name does not match that of the
# logged-in user. Both the user&#39;s primary group is matched, as well as
# groups in which users are explicitly listed.
# To avoid problems with accounts, which have the same name as a group,
# you can use brackets around group names &#39;(group)&#39; to differentiate.
# In this case, you should also set the &#34;nodefgroup&#34; option.
#
# TTY NAMES: Must be in the form returned by ttyname(3) less the initial
# &#34;/dev&#34; (e.g. tty1 or vc/1)
