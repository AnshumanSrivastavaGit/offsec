ANSI color bit for Windows is not set. If you are execcuting this from a Windows terminal inside the host you should run 'REG ADD HKCU\Console /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1' and then start a new CMD
Long paths are disabled, so the maximum length of a path supported is 260chars (this may cause false negatives when looking for files). If you are admin, you can enable it with 'REG ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem /v VirtualTerminalLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 1' and then start a new CMD
